Algorithms by Sedgewick.

Requires [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) in your classpath.  
In IntelliJ, File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> Add algs4.jar

Also requires "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.8.1".  
Easiest way is to open any test file, hover over any import with "jupiter" written on it,
and let intellij handle the rest.

## Topics to Redo
